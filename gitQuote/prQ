If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside.

Computers are getting smarter all the time.  Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us. And by ‘they’, I mean ‘computers’.  I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.
    -- Dave Barry

I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture.  Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS.

The bulk of all patents are crap.  Spending time reading them is stupid.  It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them.

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
    -- Brian Kernigan

Complexity kills.  It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.
    -- Ray Ozzie

There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
    -- C.A.R. Hoare
%
The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.
    -- Grady Booch

There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone.  That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone.

Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment.

The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.

There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.

PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.

The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense.

It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC.  As potential programmers, they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing.

Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.

GC is not a generic solution for memory leaks but a (correct) GC is a generic solution for 'dangling pointers'. Just as there is no general solution for 'loops' (due to undecidability), there is no general solution for 'leaks'.

The lesson that has been repeated most often during bash development is that there are dark corners in the Bourne Shell, and people use all of them.

While there is no universal definition of software architecture, there is no shortage of them, either. The Software Engineering Institute’s web site collects definitions from the literature and from practitioners; at the time this book was published, the collection numbered over 90.
