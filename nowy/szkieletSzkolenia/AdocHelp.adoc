.A word of warning from the wise:
[quote, Brendan Gregg, http://www.brendangregg.com/USEmethod/use-rosetta.html]
The man page for vmstat describes "r" as "The number of processes waiting for run time", which is either incorrect or misleading (on recent Linux distributions it's reporting those threads that are waiting, and threads that are running on-CPU; it's just the wait threads in other OSes).



[IMPORTANT]
.Thread lifecycle
======
*Enum: `java.lang.Thread.State`:*

NEW:: Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.

RUNNABLE:: Thread state for a runnable thread.
[CAUTION]
.Nested blocks are OK if more = signs are in
====
 _RUNNABLE_ means OK, right?
====

`Thread.getState()` gives you that.
======

== Nested lists are ok

. `kill -L` - no such option on my Ubuntu/Bash
.. `kill -l`
. `/bin/kill -L`
.. `/bin/kill -l` - same as built-in

== Admonition with title and formatting

[CAUTION]
.Java and signals
==== 
`-Xrs`:: disables default signals for Java applications
