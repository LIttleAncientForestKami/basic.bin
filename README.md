Basic bin
=========

Useful shell scripts I wanna have with me. Unless otherwise mentioned in the file: GNU GPL v3 applies.

Git-quote
---------

A fun side-project, when I was learning Git. Uses `fortune` and `git` to append a random quote to git log message.

### Howto

* clone the repository
* `sudo apt-get install fortune` if you don't have it already
* put prQ file where fortune was installed (\usr\share\games\fortune ?)
